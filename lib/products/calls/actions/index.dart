// Converted from ./mattermost-mobile/app/products/calls/actions/index.ts
// In Dart, instead of exporting functions, we import them in the files where we need to use them.
// The original file content is as follows:

/*
export {
    loadConfig,
    loadCalls,
    enableChannelCalls,
    joinCall,
    leaveCall,
    muteMyself,
    unmuteMyself,
    raiseHand,
    unraiseHand,
    setSpeakerphoneOn,
    handleCallsSlashCommand,
    startCallRecording,
    stopCallRecording,
    dismissIncomingCall,
} from './calls';

export {hasMicrophonePermission} from './permissions';

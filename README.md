# Mattermost Flutter Client

Welcome to the Mattermost Flutter Client project! ðŸš€

## Introduction

Mattermost is a powerful open-source messaging platform designed for team collaboration. We are excited to bring Mattermost to the Flutter community, leveraging the power of AI to kickstart this innovative project.

## Project Vision

Our goal is to develop a full-fledged Mattermost client in Flutter, making it accessible on all platforms - mobile, web, and desktop. This project aims to harness the strengths of Flutter's unified codebase and Mattermost's robust messaging capabilities.

## Why Flutter?

Flutter is the most popular framework for cross-platform development, with a market share of 42%. By developing a Mattermost client in Flutter, we can reach a broader audience and provide a seamless experience across all devices.

## The Role of AI

We used CrewAI, built on top of Langchain, to generate the initial codebase of this project. AI has helped us quickly lay the foundation, and now we need your expertise to refine, enhance, and make it production-ready.
